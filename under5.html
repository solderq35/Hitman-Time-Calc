			<h3>
			Mathematics/ Code Explanation
			</h3>
			<p>The full mathematical formula for calculating in game time from score, for runs of less than 5 minutes in-game time, is:
			<br> 
			<br>
			<b>(210,000 - (N * 100,000 / M)) * (3 / 400)</b>
			<br>
			<br> 
			The full mathematical formula for calculating in game time from score, for runs of 5 to 15 minutes, is:
			<br> 
			<br>
			<b>(175,000 - (N * 100,000 / M)) * (3 / 50)</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Let N = The Score shown on screen
			<br>
			Let M = The Bonuses and Penalties added up. 
			<br> 
			<br>
			Each Silent Assassin Bonus (Objectives Complete, Never Spotted, No Noticed Kills, No Bodies Found, No Recordings) is 20k points towards the M value, while each nontarget kill is -5k points 
			towards the M value. Note that the Time Bonus does not count towards the M value. The maximum M value is 100,000.

			If confused by terminology in above paragraph, refer to this reference image of Detailed Score (press P on a Hitman mission rating screen to get to this menu in-game)</a>
			<br>
			<br>
			Since most players do not show Detailed Score Menu in their run submissions, this site runs a script to account for
			all 20 possible M values, and calculates 20 possible decimal times as a result. The user is asked to report the the time shown on the rating screen (which rounds down to the nearest second). The calculated decimal time that
			is closest to the time shown on the rating screen is displayed to the user.
			<br>
			<br>
			Any decimal values smaller than 0.001 seconds in the final result are rounded down. In addition, in some rare 
			cases, the rating screen time does not match the calculated decimal time rounded down to the nearest second. These
			can be manually rounded to the next fastest second as needed for leaderboard purposes.

			<h3> 
			Usage Quirks
			</h3>
			This formula does not work when the N value (Score) and/or M value (Penalties/Bonuses) are 0. Note that one of the Silent Assassin bonuses is "Objectives Complete", and you are almost guaranteed to get points for this simply by killing all targets and exiting the mission. The score can become 0 either due to:
			<ul>
				<li>Killing too many nontargets (each nontarget kill is -5k in the Bonuses and Penalties (M) score)</li>
				<li>Finishing the mission in less than 7 seconds (IOI's "anticheat", currently this only applies to Dubai any% in terms of main missions)</li>
			</ul>
